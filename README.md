# JAVA-Stock-Mangement
I have made a stock and portfolio management project using JAVA as programming language and MS Excell as the database. It follows the MVC architecture in which user gets the login functionality and once logged in can view the stocks which are held under their demat account and can also apply various queries on their stock management database
